# Guile Homebrew Tap

The goal of Guile Homebrew Tap is to provide
[Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/) libraries and applications that
can be easily installed with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

Bottles?

Happy hacking!

## How do I install these formulae?

If you installed Guile through Homebrew before May 28, 2020, you will need to
reinstall it:

`brew reinstall guile`

After that you can do any of the following:

`brew install aconchillo/guile/<formula>`

Or `brew tap aconchillo/guile` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or install via URL (which will not receive updates):

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aconchillo/homebrew-guile/master/Formula/<formula>.rb
```

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
